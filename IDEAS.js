// What if I can spend gems on upgranding my home?
// What if I can spend gems on upgrading my community?
// i.e. playground, fitness park, walking trail, performance stage
// i.e. pre-school, community garden

// maybe I can buy clothes and give others clothes
// an interactive marketplace like Runescape & learn finance, economics
// what if I could group fund projects in-game
// like I need x number of coins, but also community support
